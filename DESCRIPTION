Description: tLOH, or transcriptomicsLOH, assesses evidence for loss of 
    heterozygosity (LOH) in pre-processed spatial transcriptomics 
    data. This tool requires spatial transcriptomics cluster and allele count 
    information at likely heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
    positions in VCF format. Bayes factors are calculated at each SNP to 
    determine likelihood of potential loss of heterozygosity event. Two plotting 
    functions are included to visualize allele fraction and aggregated Bayes 
    factor per chromosome. Data generated with the 10X Genomics Visium Spatial 
    Gene Expression platform must be pre-processed to obtain an individual 
    sample VCF with columns for each cluster. Required fields are allele depth 
    (AD) with counts for reference/alternative alleles and read depth (DP).
