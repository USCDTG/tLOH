Description: tLOH, or transcriptomicsLOH, assesses evidence for loss of 
    heterozygosity (LOH) in pre-processed spatial transcriptomics 
    data. This tool requires spatial transcriptomics cluster and allele count 
    information at likely heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
    positions. Bayes factors are calculated at each SNP to determine likelihood 
    of potential loss of heterozygosity event. A plotting function is included 
    to visualize allele fraction and aggregated Bayes factor per chromosome. 
    Data generated with the 10X Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression platform 
    must be pre-processed using the instructions at 
    https://github.com/USCDTG/spatialAlleleCountPipeline to obtain an individual 
    sample directory of per-cluster .csv's for input to tLOH.
